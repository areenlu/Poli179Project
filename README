Political Advertisements Analysis on Facebook

Overview

This repository provides a framework for analyzing political advertisements on Facebook, focusing on the shift in topics and strategies following significant events. The project employs a multimodal approach, combining image and text data analysis, to uncover patterns and trends in political advertising.

Research Questions

Topic Shifts in Political Ads: How did political advertisers on Facebook shift the topics and perspectives covered in advertisements following the Parkland school shooting and subsequent March for Our Lives protest?
Strategy Differences by Political Affiliation: Is there a clear separation in overall strategy from Democrat and Republican-leaning sources?
Description of Data

Source: Political advertisements posted on Facebook from September 2017 to September 2019, collected by ProPublica (2020).
Size: Approximately 10 gigabytes, including images.
Contents: Titles, content, advertisers, targeting information, ad reach, classifications based on user input and a machine learning classifier.
Methodology

Approach
A multimodal approach is used to analyze political ads, integrating both image and text data. The analysis references the MARMOT methodology, employing a transformer-based model that learns patterns between image and text features.

Image Analysis
Model: Pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
Image Captioning: VisionEncoderDecoderModel.
Preprocessing: Resizing images, controlling batch size, converting to grayscale (if necessary), handling gif files by selecting the first frame or removing them.
Text Analysis
Model: BERT, a pre-trained language model, to convert image captions and features into text features.
Evaluation
Metrics: Krippendorff's alpha, evaluation metrics.
Data Preprocessing
Extract relevant image and text features.
Create training and test sets for model evaluation.


Current State of Project:

- Exploring specific image captioning model, testing on a subset of data (VisionEncoderTesting.ipynb)
- Doing initial text exploratory analysis, testing with simplistic presence of words based classification (while MARMOT pipeline is being established) (Text Exploratory Analysis.ipynb)
- Create a script incorporating each of MARMOT's classes, replicating the binary classification pipeline with a subset of data. (MARMOT-Pipeline.ipynb)
